AutoName: PhoneBlock Mobile
Description: |
  PhoneBlock Mobile identifies and blocks spam phone calls using a
  community-maintained database. When someone calls, the app checks
  the number against the PhoneBlock database and blocks known spam
  callers automatically.

  Features:
  * Automatic call screening using Android's CallScreeningService
  * Community-driven spam database with thousands of reported numbers
  * Call history with spam ratings, caller location, and labels
  * Configurable blocking threshold
  * Personal black/white lists synced with the server
  * Dark mode support

  Requires a free PhoneBlock account at phoneblock.net.
