PhoneBlock Mobile identifies and blocks spam phone calls using a
community-maintained database. When someone calls, the app checks
the number against the PhoneBlock database and blocks known spam
callers automatically.

Features:
* Automatic call screening using Android's CallScreeningService
* Community-driven spam database with thousands of reported numbers
* Call history with spam ratings, caller location, and labels
* Configurable blocking threshold
* Personal black/white lists synced with the server
* Dark mode support

Requires a free PhoneBlock account at phoneblock.net.
