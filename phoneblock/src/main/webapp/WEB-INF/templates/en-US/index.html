		<p data-tx="t0002:d74f7216">Has your phone number also fallen into the hands of dubious address dealers and you are constantly receiving annoying calls that want to "optimize" your electricity bill, give you advice on a solar system, announce another grand prize or offer other "perks"? Then <b>PhoneBlock</b> is exactly what you need!</p>

		<div th:replace="~{fragments/page :: buttons}"></div>

		<h2 data-tx="t0007:20eeb709">How does PhoneBlock work?</h2>

		<h3 data-tx="t0029:e557e16d">The community blacklist</h3>

		<p data-tx="t0008:62e0be42">PhoneBlock is a list maintained by the PhoneBlock community of telephone numbers that are suspected of being spam. The <a th:href="@{/anrufbeantworter}">PhoneBlock answering machine</a> then accepts calls from callers on the block list so that your phone remains silent for these calls.</p>

		<h3 data-tx="t0030:397ca321">Alternative: FRITZ!Box phone book</h3>

		<p data-tx="t0009:149bd771">Alternatively, you can also import the blacklist as a phone book into your "FRITZ!Box" Internet router and block calls from numbers in this <a th:href="@{/setup}">special phone book</a>. You no longer have to manually block number ranges, because your Fritz!Box automatically updates the blocked list every night. As soon as a number is added to this blacklist, your FRITZ!Box automatically rejects callers with this number. However, the <a th:href="@{/anrufbeantworter}">answering machine</a> is the better solution because a phone book is limited in size and cannot hold all the numbers in the block list.</p>

		<h3 data-tx="t0031:6045153a">Report SPAM numbers</h3>

		<p data-tx="t0010:34e8fe06">If you still receive an unwanted call because the number has not yet been added to the block list, you can report the number and thus protect the entire PhoneBlock community from <a th:href="@{/status}">further spam calls</a>. You have several options: Report SPAM directly from the PhoneBlock app, search and rate the number on the website, or <a th:href="@{/block}">block the number in your FRITZ!Box</a> by making an entry in the PhoneBlock address book. As soon as a number is reported, it is added to the blocked list and all other PhoneBlock users are automatically protected.</p>

		<h2 data-tx="t0011:db4a3206">What are the requirements?</h2>

		<p data-tx="t0020:537ee553">PhoneBlock supports various platforms for blocking unwanted calls:</p>
