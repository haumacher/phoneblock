t0001=Android installation
t0002=PhoneBlock Mobile App
t0003=The <x1>PhoneBlock Mobile App</x1> is the official app for detecting and blocking SPAM calls directly on your Android smartphone. The app uses Android's built-in call filtering to automatically block SPAM calls before your phone rings.
t0004=Functions
t0005=<x1>Automatic SPAM blocking:</x1> Calls from known SPAM numbers are blocked directly
t0006=<x1>Call history:</x1> Overview of blocked and missed calls (only from unknown numbers that are not in your contact list)
t0007=<x1>Report number:</x1> Report SPAM numbers directly from the app
t0008=<x1>Personal lists:</x1> Manage your own blacklist and whitelist
t0009=<x1>Maximum data protection:</x1> For incoming calls, only the SHA-1 hash of the number is transmitted to the server, not the number itself. PhoneBlock therefore does not find out who has called unless it is a known SPAM number.
t0010=<x1>No contact list access:</x1> The app does not need access to your contacts. Numbers from your phone book are never processed by PhoneBlock Mobile.
t0011=Installation
t0012=Step 1: Download the app
t0013=Download the PhoneBlock mobile app from the Google Play Store: <x1></x1> <x2> <x3>Open in Play Store</x3> </x2>
t0014=Step 2: Connect with PhoneBlock
t0015=Open the app and tap on "Connect to PhoneBlock". You will be redirected to PhoneBlock to log in. Once you have successfully logged in, an access token for the app will be created automatically.
t0016.alt=Open and connect the app
t0017.alt=Registration with PhoneBlock
t0018=Step 3: Grant authorizations
t0019=In order for the app to block SPAM calls, it needs permission to filter calls. Tap on "Request permission" and allow the app access to call filtering in the Android settings.
t0020=<x1>System requirement:</x1> PhoneBlock Mobile requires at least Android 10 (API 29). Call filtering (CallScreeningService) is only available in Android from this version onwards.
t0021=Step 4: Done!
t0022=The app is now active and automatically blocks SPAM calls. You can in the app:
t0023=View blocked and missed calls
t0024=Report numbers as SPAM or legitimate
t0025=Manage your personal blacklist and whitelist
t0026=Search by number
t0027=Important for those switching from CardDAV synchronization:
t0028=If you have previously used the CardDAV method with PeopleSync or DAVx\u2075, you must perform the following steps before using PhoneBlock Mobile:
t0029=Deactivate the CardDAV synchronization of the PhoneBlock blocklist in PeopleSync/DAVx\u2075
t0030=Delete the synchronized SPAM contacts from your phone book
t0031=<x1>Reason:</x1> For data protection reasons, PhoneBlock Mobile does not process numbers that are saved in your contact list. If SPAM numbers remain saved as contacts, they cannot be recognized and blocked by the app.
t0032=Alternative: SpamBlocker
t0033=In addition to the official PhoneBlock Mobile app, you can also use the independent app <x1>SpamBlocker</x1> and integrate the PhoneBlock database. You can find instructions here: <x2>Setup SpamBlocker with PhoneBlock</x2>.

t0068=<x1>Recommendation:</x1> If you want a simple, directly integrated solution for PhoneBlock, use <x2>PhoneBlock Mobile</x2>. If you want to use advanced filter functions, SMS filtering or multiple SPAM databases, <x3>SpamBlocker</x3> is the better choice.
t0069=<x1>Note:</x1> SpamBlocker is an independent app. Please contact the <x2>developer</x2> directly if you have any problems.
t0070=Alternative: CardDAV synchronization (obsolete)
t0071=The previous method using CardDAV synchronization with apps such as PeopleSync or DAVx\u2075 is still possible, but <x1>no longer recommended</x1>. This method only shows SPAM numbers in your contacts, but does not block calls.
t0072=Advantages of the CardDAV method:
t0073=Also works on older Android versions (before Android 10)
t0074=Shows SPAM label in missed calls
t0075=Disadvantages:
t0076=No automatic blocking
t0077=Phone still rings with SPAM calls
t0078=Additional app required for CardDAV sync
t0079=More complex setup
t0080=If you still want to use the CardDAV method, you can find the instructions in the <x1>PhoneBlock blog</x1>.
