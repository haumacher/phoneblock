t0023=Search tips
t0024=Format of the telephone number
t0025=For best search results enter the number with country code:
t0026=<x1>Germany:</x1> +49 or 0049 before the number (e.g. +49 30 12345678)
t0027=<x1>Switzerland:</x1> +41 or 0041 before the number
t0028=<x1>Austria:</x1> +43 or 0043 before the number
